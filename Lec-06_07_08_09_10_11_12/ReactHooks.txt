Why do we need react,why is it faster?
So that the UI layer and data layer are in sync with each other
Because it can do efficient DOM Manipulation,there are concepts like Virtual DOM,reconciliation
Without React Manually Doing state management becomes difficult.


What are Hooks?
Hooks are the normal JS utility function given to us by react,this functions come with super-powers which has some logic written behind the scenes.It keeps the UI in sync with the variables

There are 2 ways in which i can use the hooks in react.
1.import React from 'react'
const [num,func] = React.useState(0);

2.import {useState} from 'react'
const [num,func] = useState(0);


RULES:
1.Always declare the hook inside a component or custom hook only
2.Whenever a state variable updates react re-renders the component where it has been used.

1.useState()  =>  super-powerful state variables in react
It maintains the state of the variable all over the aplication.
const [var_name] = useState( Defaultvalue )

üîÅ What exactly does useState return?
It returns an array with 2 values

state ‚Üí The current state value
setState ‚Üí A function that lets you update that state


WORKING :

how to change the data ?
use the setFunction 
setFunction(pass the new data and it would be changed across all the areas where u have used that variable)



2.useEffect()
This is a hook where we pass two arguments : callback function and a dependency array.

useEffect(() => {},[])


Now the question comes is when will the callback function be called?
When we write this hook inside a component,once the componentis been rendered,then the callback function of the useEffect is been called. 

More precisely, it's called after the DOM has been painted (i.e., after the render phase).
This makes useEffect() perfect for things like data fetching, DOM manipulation, or setting up subscriptions.

React first renders the component ‚Üí updates the DOM ‚Üí then calls useEffect()
It‚Äôs like saying: "Now that I‚Äôve painted your part of the wall, you can go run your side job."

No matter where you place the useEffect() inside a component ‚Äî top, middle, or bottom of the component body ‚Äî the useEffect callback will always run after the component finishes rendering and commits to the DOM.























SOME IMPORTANT POINTS :
1.  //unlike the button onClick,here the return is sent to the div so that would be rendered automatically 
    // That‚Äôs how React works ‚Äî it watches what you return from your component, and renders it to the DOM.
    // Yes, return values inside the render or JSX block will be rendered.
    // Return values inside event handlers like onClick will be ignored unless they affect state.




REACT DOM OPTIMISATION :

React optimizes DOM updates using a reconciliation algorithm, implemented through the React Fiber architecture.
When a state variable changes, the corresponding component re-renders using the Virtual DOM, which is a lightweight representation of the real DOM.
React uses a diffing algorithm to compare the new Virtual DOM with the previous one, and applies only the minimal changes to the actual DOM.

The Virtual DOM is an in-memory (JavaScript) object representation of the actual DOM.

| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Reconciliation** | The **overall process** React uses to update the DOM                                         | Every time a component's state or props change |
| **Diffing**        | The **specific step** inside reconciliation where React **compares** old and new Virtual DOM | To find **what exactly changed**               |


‚öõÔ∏è What is React Fiber?
React Fiber is the core architecture and rendering engine behind React (since React 16).
It enables incremental rendering, prioritization, and interruptibility of work.

In simple terms:
React Fiber is the new engine that performs reconciliation and scheduling intelligently

Under the hood what happens is 
React reads your component's JSX and builds a Virtual DOM (in memory) using JavaScript objects
React translates that Virtual DOM into real DOM nodes and inserts them into the actual browser DOM

First, the Virtual DOM is created.
Then, the Actual (Real) DOM is created or updated based on the Virtual DOM.
