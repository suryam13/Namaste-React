        <!-- 
        why do i write crossorigin?
        The crossorigin attribute tells the browser how to handle requests for resources (like JS files) that come from a different origin (i.e., domain, protocol, or port) than your webpage.
        That’s a cross-origin request because:

        Your site is suryam.com

        You're requesting a file from unpkg.com (another domain) -->



        <script src="/Lec-1/app.js"> 
        // would writing crossorigin here give error ? 
        //  Would writing crossorigin in a local script give an error?
        // ❌ No, it won't give an error, but it's unnecessary and ignored.
        </script>
